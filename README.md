DeisRides is the demo version of an application we eventually would like to create. This program can be opened in Atom and run through one’s terminal. DeisRides provides a platform for Brandeis University students to share their vehicles with other members of the community. When one first launches DeisRides in their terminal, they are asked the simple question of what type of user they currently are, either a driver or rider. Once answered, Drivers are directed to an interactive questionnaire that gathers the information needed to create a new trip for the global list “Riders”. However, riders are immediately directed choose their desired destination, which will filter the list of current available rides. For the purposes of this assignment, we have created our own fixed list of examples that are visible to our users, but ultimately this list will update automatically as drivers input their own information. We hope that this program will work as a way for students to connect regularly and save money otherwise wasted on Uber! Please remember to input Python3 in order to launch the program successfully. We suggest first stating you are a driver so that you can see your information added to the list of previously inputed rides.
